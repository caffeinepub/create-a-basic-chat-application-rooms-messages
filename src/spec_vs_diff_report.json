  "summary": "Frontend adds a Voice UI (tab/panel) with polling-based React Query hooks, and adds a profile viewer dialog that can be opened from message senders, friends list entries, and invite-to-room friend cards. Backend changes shown are focused on user profile read/write authorization and social-related types/methods, but the diff summary does not show any backend implementation of the required room-scoped voice signaling APIs (create/join/leave/post/fetch incremental).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-64",
      "requirement": "Add backend support for room-scoped voice chat signaling (polling-based) with canister methods to create/start, join, leave/end, post signaling messages (offer/answer/ice), and fetch messages incrementally (afterId + limit), enforcing authenticated-user and room-membership access control.",
      "reason": "The frontend introduces hooks that call actor methods like startVoiceSession/endVoiceSession/sendSdpOffer/sendSdpAnswer/addIceCandidate/getVoiceSessionState, but the backend diff shown does not include any corresponding voice-session or signaling message storage, nor the required incremental fetch (afterId/limit) APIs. Without these backend methods, REQ-64 is not implemented based on the provided diff summary.",
