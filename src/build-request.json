        "In Settings, the Theme dropdown includes a new option labeled \"Black\" (English text).",
        "Selecting \"Black\" calls the existing theme application mechanism (next-themes) using a stable theme value (e.g., \"black\").",
        "A corresponding `.black` theme class is defined in `frontend/src/index.css` that sets `--background` to a true/near-true black and updates related variables (`--foreground`, `--card`, `--border`, `--muted`, etc.) so text and UI controls remain readable and consistent.",
        "When the Black theme is selected, the app UI (header, sidebar, dialogs, message thread, and inputs) visibly switches to the Black palette without breaking contrast or readability.",
        "Existing theme options (Light, Dark, System Default) continue to work as before."
